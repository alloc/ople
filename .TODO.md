- track the completion of batch requests to avoid duplicate calls
- let a client recover batch requests from a previous connection
- prevent DoS attack when merging pushed changes (https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-IMMER-1019369)
- feat: Provide a way to merge a property into every document (of a specific type) when fetched that is derived from a query. This property can be
  optionally omitted.
- feat: Provide server-side caching mechanism that can reduce database reads.

# Batching

By default, batched operations are parallel.
This means there are no guarantees of completion order.

"Serial queues" execute their operations in order.

- Unlike transactions, they persist between batches, so future
  operations must wait for operations from preceding batches to
  complete (assuming those operations are in the same serial queue).
- Without chaining, operations cannot reference each other.

"Transactions" execute their operations in order.

- They can be executed within another serial queue.
- They are basically single-use serial queues.
- When an operation fails, no future operations are executed.
- Any operations queued within a `runSerial` callback are
  wrapped in a transaction.
- Without chaining, operations cannot reference each other.

```ts
import { runSerial } from 'ople'

runSerial(() => {...})
  .then(onFinish)
  .catch(onError)
```

### Batch Serialization

- batch type in @ople/nason
  - connection id
  - pushed changes (ref => changed values)
  - watched/unwatched refs
  - remote calls
  - pulled refs
