# User Authentication

```ts
// Once resolved, future requests are authenticated.
await api.login(user, password)
```

When `login` is called by the backend, the password is optional.
This is convenient when using an external authentication provider.

```ts
const token = await db.login(user)
```

### Fetch the current user

```ts
import api from './api'

api.currentUser // => Ref

api.get(api.currentUser) // => Promise<Record>
```

## JSON Web Tokens

When authenticated, a JWT is generated and signed with the following data:

- `user: string` The unique user identifier that was generated by Fauna, not including the collection or database names.
- `secret: string` The database token for acting on behalf of the user.
