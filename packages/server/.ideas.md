## Queries

- UDFs are scanned from `q` assignments in the `src/queries` directory

- The `src/queries/q.ts` module is generated. It contains the type of every UDF.
  UDF modules can import from `./q` to have access to other UDF modules, as well
  as preset queries.

- The `src/queries/index.ts` module is generated. It creates the client for
  building queries that can be executed by `db.query(...)` calls.

```ts
import q, {Ref} from './q'

const relations = q.Collection('relations')

q.AddFriend = (user: Ref, friend: Ref) => {
  // Some keys are reserved for document metadata.
  user.ts // => number
  user.data // => object

  // Some keys are reserved for document methods.
  user.delete() // => void

  // Remaining keys provide access to document data.
  user.name // => string

  // Collections have mutative methods.
  relations.add({ user, friend })
}
```
