Event-driven, observable data flow for React ðŸ’¥ðŸ‘€

**Features**

- Transparent observability for seamless, reactive data flow
- Automatic disposal of event listeners and `auto` reactions
- Compatible with all [`wana`](https://github.com/alloc/wana) functions
- Mixins for sharable behavior (inspired by React hooks)
- Strict type safety with TypeScript
- Objects are readonly outside their initializer
- Objects have built-in event emitting
- Highly minifiable code
- Concise, distilled API

&nbsp;

## Usage

The `createOple` function constructs an Ople object, which is both observable
and readonly to React components. Expose methods for React components to call, 
and expose events for React components to subscribe to.

```
TODO: document the "createOple" function
```

## Classes

If you like creating objects with `new` syntax or you prefer storing your methods
on a prototype for efficiency, you can create an `Ople` subclass. For more info,
see the [Classes](./docs/classes.md) page.

## Mixins

As an alternative to classes (which limit you to a single superclass), you can
use "mixin functions" to share behavior between your Ople objects. Mixins should
be very familiar to anyone who uses React hooks. Just remember, mixins are **NOT**
subject to the same rules as React hooks. For example, mixins can be called from
within `if` blocks. The **only rule** of mixins is that you should only ever call
them from within an Ople context (eg: inside a `createOple` initializer).

For more info, see the [Mixins](./docs/mixins.md) page.
